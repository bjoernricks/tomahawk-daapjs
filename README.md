**Description:**

A Digital Audio Access Protocol ([DAAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Access_Protocol))
resolver for [Tomahawk Player](http://www.tomahawk-player.org/). DAAP is the
http based protocol for sharing music used by iTunes®. A very good free and open
server solution is [forked-daap](https://github.com/ejurgensen/forked-daapd).

## How does it work: ##
This is a simple resolver for Tomahawk which will add you a DAAP collection.
Simply clone or download this repo and install the resolver.js file as a
Tomahawk plugin. Afterwards configure your Server Host (IP or Domain), the Port
(usually 3689) and the Password (if the server usesone). It works on your LAN
and WAN network.
